    "The dataset used in this series is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set. This dataset is publicly available from the [University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic). It consists of characteristics, or features, of cell nuclei taken from breast masses which were sampled using fine-needle aspiration (FNA), a common diagnostic procedure in oncology. The clinical samples used to form this dataset were collected from January 1989 to November 1991. Relevant features were extracted from the digital images using Multisurface Method-Tree (K.P. Bennett 1992), a classifcation method that uses linear programming to construct a decision tree, a form of machine learning! An example of one of the digitised images from an FNA sample is given below"
